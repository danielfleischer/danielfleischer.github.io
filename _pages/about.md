<h5>Advancing AI reasoning through open-source tools and research</h5>

I'm an AI Research Engineer working to make artificial intelligence more capable and accessible. I build open-source libraries that help developers integrate AI into their workflows, focusing on the intersection of research and practical implementation.

My primary contributions include open-source tools for running AI workflows on Intel hardware and a framework that simplifies LLM fine-tuning for RAG applications. Currently developing agentic systems for enhanced reasoning and experimenting with GRPO training methods to advance AI capabilities.

Always excited to collaborate with fellow researchers and engineers pushing the boundaries of what AI can accomplish.
