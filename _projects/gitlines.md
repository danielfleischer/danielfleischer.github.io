Small python app to plot committed lines change as a function of time. One can see a project's evolution. Things I learned: building and uploading to PyPI.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-10 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/lines.png" title="Committed lines in a project." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
