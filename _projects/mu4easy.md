Emacs + emails = ❤️ mu4e.

I really like email technology: it's ancient, ubiquitous, mostly open-source and it works. However, we tend to lose control when we delegate more and more to others. Managing emails locally is taking a small step in self-sufficiency. [mu4e](https://github.com/djcb/mu) is a wonderful tool to index, search, read and write emails in Emacs. However, configuring it for multiple accounts and aliases is a hassle.

I created a [mu4easy](https://melpa.org/#/mu4easy) to help with that. The project can also be used as an Emacs configuration starting point; I provide both mbsync configuration examples and elisp code.
