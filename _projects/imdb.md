A simple CLI application to search movies and shows on IMDB, using the (free) OMDB API.

It's my first **Vibe app**; I chose Golang, which I had no experience with. Using [Aider](https://aider.chat/) with an Emacs integration, I created it in a week, using a strong model from OpenAI. Quite a fun project!

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-10 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/imdb1.png" title="Claude queries my emails using MCP server" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/imdb2.png" title="Claude queries my emails using MCP server" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
