A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for querying your local [mu](https://github.com/djcb/mu) mail index. You can query and show emails and open attachments. Toy project to teach myself about MCP protocol. It works remarkably well with Claude and quite easy to understand what's happening - it's all in the docstring!
