However, they primarily operate in English, creating barriers for non-English speaking educational communities. Hebrew speakers, in particular, have faced challenges accessing these powerful educational tools in their native language.Simply translating outputs isn’t enough—effective mathematical tutoring requires natural language flow, culturally appropriate explanations, and seamless integration of Hebrew text with mathematical notation. This requires a more sophisticated approach.Hebrew Math Tutor addresses these challenges through targeted fine-tuning of Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, a powerful 4-billion parameter mathematical reasoning model. Our approach focuses on three key principles:The model provides complete mathematical explanations in natural Hebrew while preserving mathematical notation and formal expressions. It understands Hebrew mathematical terminology and can explain complex concepts using appropriate pedagogical language.By carefully fine-tuning rather than training from scratch, we maintain the model’s core mathematical reasoning capabilities while adapting its communication style to Hebrew.At ~4 billion parameters, the model strikes an optimal balance between capability and computational efficiency, making it practical for educational applications and research prototyping.Creating an effective Hebrew math model required more than simple translation. Our methodology involved:We selected ~10,000 high-quality problems from the OpenMathReasoning dataset, translating questions and answers to Hebrew while preserving the original reasoning chains and mathematical notation.We fine-tuned the model over 3 epochs with optimized parameters (learning rate 5e-6, 0.1 warmup, cosine scheduling) to adapt the output language while maintaining the underlying reasoning capabilities.The model’s internal <think>...</think> reasoning blocks remain in English, as these represent core computational processes that would require more extensive training to modify.We evaluated Hebrew Math Tutor against its base model on three challenging mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 (curriculum problems), AIME24, and AIME25 (competition mathematics). The results demonstrate significant improvements in Hebrew language output while maintaining strong technical performance.🚀 Dramatic Hebrew Language Gains: Hebrew answer production jumped from 35-75% to 95-100% across all benchmarks—a transformative improvement for Hebrew-speaking users.📈 Consistent Accuracy Improvements: Notable gains in pass@16 scores on Hebrew evaluations, showing the model doesn’t just translate but actually improves problem-solving in Hebrew contexts.🔄 Preserved Core Capabilities: Maintained competitive English performance, demonstrating that Hebrew specialization didn’t compromise the model’s fundamental mathematical abilities.⚖️ Nuanced Majority Vote Results: While performance improved on MATH500 and remained stable on AIME24, there’s an interesting decrease in maj@16 on AIME25 that provides insights for future training approaches.Hebrew Math Tutor opens new possibilities across multiple domains:Hebrew Math Tutor integrates seamlessly with the Transformers ecosystem:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hebrew Math Tutor in action: A Streamlit interface showing detailed step-by-step reasoning in Hebrew. The expandable reasoning sections allow users to dive deep into the mathematical process or focus on final answers. While Hebrew Math Tutor represents significant progress, responsible deployment requires careful consideration:The model works best as an educational aid rather than a replacement for qualified instruction. We recommend implementing human oversight, providing clear disclaimers about AI-generated content, and ensuring compliance with relevant privacy regulations in educational applications.Hebrew Math Tutor demonstrates that language barriers in AI can be effectively addressed through thoughtful fine-tuning approaches. This work represents more than just a Hebrew mathematical model—it's a proof of concept for making advanced AI capabilities truly accessible across linguistic communities.The techniques developed here can be adapted for other languages, creating a pathway toward more inclusive mathematical AI tools. As we continue to refine these approaches, we're moving closer to a future where language is no longer a barrier to accessing the most advanced educational technologies.Hebrew Math Tutor is available now under the Apache-2.0 license. We encourage the community to:🚀 Start exploring Hebrew Math Tutor today and experience mathematical AI that truly speaks your language.Built with gratitude upon the foundational work of Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 and the OpenMathReasoning dataset.·

The core unit is the persistent <strong>change</strong>, which evolves through snapshots.</li> <li>Actions are logged as operations, enabling undo and restore to any point in time.</li> <li>No Git-style branches. Changes have persistent IDs, and you use bookmarks for Git-forge workflows.</li> <li>You can colocate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> with an existing Git repo, keeping your Git workflow intact while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> handles history.</li> <li>Curious? Follow the tutorial or experiment on a current repo to see the difference firsthand.</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>In this post I’ll share some insights about using the <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/">Jujutsu version control system</a>, which I’ll call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> for the rest of the post.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> is a version control system, currently built on top of git, using its building blocks. However, it’s not just a new porcelain; it defines new abstractions and data structures of its own.</p> <h4 id="concept-the-change-as-the-atomic-unit">Concept: The Change as the Atomic Unit</h4> <p>The most important concept is the <strong>change</strong>. The <strong>change</strong> defines an atomic unit of, well, change. Its analog is the git commit. But in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code>, a change can develop in time. Technically, it’s a git commit that keeps getting amended, the difference being that the <strong>change</strong> keeps its identity via a persistent ID and a description field. A <strong>change</strong> updates whenever <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> takes a snapshot of the repo—every time you call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code>. If you think about it, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> can’t lose work, as it always starts by taking a snapshot, even for informative commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj log</code>.</p> <p>Thus the <strong>change</strong> represents an amended commit, the “last” change. However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> lets you inspect the internal, previous commits inside the <strong>change</strong>, by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj evolog</code>. These internal commits are not synced to git forges and are not automatically garbage collected, like git amended commits are.</p> <p>When we are done with a <strong>change</strong>, we can give it a description (which we can do at any time using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj description</code>) and create an empty <strong>change</strong> on top of it, ready to receive new modifications. We do that using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj commit</code>.</p> <p>For example, when you initialize a repo, the initial current <strong>change</strong> is empty. You add files, edit them. When you are ready, you give this change a name via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj description</code> and then start a new change via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj new</code>, or do both at the same time via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj commit</code>.</p> <h4 id="graph-branches-and-bookmarks">Graph, Branches, and Bookmarks</h4> <p>Moving around (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code>) is done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj edit</code>. But we need to be careful, as any edit we make after the jump will get snapshots (“amended”) on top of the current <strong>change</strong>, modifying it. If you want to jump in to do some work, it’s better to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj new</code>.</p> <p>You might see the claim there are no branches in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code>. There aren’t branches in the usual git sense. In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code>s graph there are “branches”, but they don’t need names. The persistent <strong>change</strong> IDs serve as feature names and jump addresses (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edit</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>). Nevertheless, branch names are introduced in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> in order to be compatible with git forges; they are called <strong>bookmarks</strong>, and they need to be moved explicitly across the <strong>changes</strong>.</p> <h4 id="logging-and-time-travel">Logging and Time Travel</h4> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> logs what’s happening using <strong>operations</strong>: these are the commands you enter and the current <em>change</em> you’re in, in addition to some metadata. The logs enable handy features like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj undo</code> or the deeper <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj op restore</code> (restore to any point in time). For browsing the operation log, see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj op log</code>.</p> <p>There is a <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-command-table/">comparison</a> table between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> commands, which could be useful but it’s important to not fixate on how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> is doing things in order to be open to the new paradigm <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> represents. However, some features seem to have been added in response to git users’ needs or workflows, or perhaps <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> developers rediscovered the same needs.</p> <h4 id="mixing-jj-with-git">Mixing JJ with Git</h4> <p>I chose one existing git project and converted it to a mixed usage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj git init --colocate</code>. It means <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code> initialize its presence in an existing repo and it will keep updating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder with what’s happening, at a level compatible with git constructs; for example, the <strong>changes</strong> are saved as git commits, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj git fetch</code> is fetching from git forges into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git/</code>, etc. I haven’t used rebasing, squashing or other history-changing operations so I can’t comment on how easy they are to use, maybe next time.</p> <p>If you found it interesting, give it a try. There’s the <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial/">tutorial</a>, or you can run it on an existing git repo.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="software"/><category term="git"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first impression of using the Jujutsu version control system.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Built an MCP server for LLMs to search email from terminal | Daniel Fleischer posted on the topic | LinkedIn</title><link href="https://danielfleischer.github.io/blog/2025/built-an-mcp-server-for-llms-to-search-email-from-terminal-daniel-fleischer-posted-on-the-topic-linkedin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Built an MCP server for LLMs to search email from terminal | Daniel Fleischer posted on the topic | LinkedIn"/><published>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://danielfleischer.github.io/blog/2025/built-an-mcp-server-for-llms-to-search-email-from-terminal--daniel-fleischer-posted-on-the-topic--linkedin</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielfleischer.github.io/blog/2025/built-an-mcp-server-for-llms-to-search-email-from-terminal-daniel-fleischer-posted-on-the-topic-linkedin/"><![CDATA[<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>          Agree &amp; Join LinkedIn

        📬 I built an MCP server that lets LLMs search my email from the terminal
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The server connects Claude to email search via the mu CLI tool. Now I just ask it things like: “Find emails with PDF attachments from last April” ⚡</p> <p>🛠 No custom frontend. No heavy framework. Just a CLI tool made smarter.</p> <p>💡 I learned that MCP servers are basically API translators — they take complex developer SDKs and flatten them into simple function calls that LLMs can actually use.</p> <p>🎯 The bigger picture: This pattern can breathe new life into existing CLI tools and services. Complex APIs → Simple, declarative functions → Natural language queries.</p> <p>This isn’t a product — just an experiment in stitching new capabilities into existing workflows.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>I built Conduit to solve this. It’s an open-source tool that automatically exposes any existing GraphQL API to an LLM as a ready-to-use toolset.</p> <p>Conduit leverages GraphQL’s strong typing and introspection capabilities to dynamically generate a tool manifest via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). An AI agent can connect to Conduit, understand the available tools (your GraphQL queries/mutations), and execute them.</p> <p>This automates the most tedious part of giving AI agents new capabilities, allowing you to focus on the agent’s logic instead of the boilerplate. The entire project is written in TypeScript.</p> <p>If you’re building with LLMs and need to connect to GraphQL data sources, this might save you a lot of time.</p> <p>Contributions and feedback are welcome!

        After MCP, A2A, &amp; AG-UI, there's another Agent protocol that is  ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) and the best Part is it is fully Open Source
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But before we dive into ACP, let’s quickly revisit the earlier 3 👇</p> <ol> <li> <p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) Problem before MCP: Every new tool = custom integration code With MCP: One universal adapter for APIs, tools, files. -&gt; Think of it as the USB-C for agents — plug anything in, it just works.</p> </li> <li> <p>A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Problem before A2A: Agents couldn’t hand off tasks cleanly → worked in silos. With A2A: Agents collaborate like a team with walkie-talkies  -&gt; Funny Part is: Google made this A2A protocol just to show they’re updated in the market, like saying yes, after MCP, we’ve launched something new.</p> </li> <li> <p>AG-UI (Agent → UI) Problem before AG-UI: Each agent gave random outputs → frontend devs had to write messy glue code. With AG-UI: Agents return standard UI components (forms, tables, charts). -&gt; Basically → one design system for AI outputs</p> </li> <li> <p>ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) — by IBM ACP is like a traffic control system for coordinating agents at scale. It’s open source, RESTful, and even ships with a Python SDK!</p> </li> </ol> <p>Key ACP Features (solution-architect friendly):</p> <ol> <li>Supports both stateful and stateless agents</li> <li>Uses JSON-RPC for structured, reliable comms</li> <li>Handles natural language interfaces (so humans ↔ agents is smooth)</li> <li>Offers real-time streaming (great for live dashboards, chat)</li> <li>Flexible deployment + legacy integration (you can fit it in old infra too) -&gt;  In short: ACP = the dispatcher + rulebook for multiple agents working together.</li> </ol> <p>#AI #ArtificialIntelligence #AIAgents #AgenticAI #MultiAgentSystems #AICommunity #OpenSourceAI #AIStandards To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>            I help labs reduce costs and improve the quality of diagnostics by the means of AI

        MCP is getting serious: first benchmark for real tool‑use
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) launched about nine months ago (Nov 2024) and has been spreading fast across major platforms. It’s the “plug” that lets models talk to real tools and data.</p> <p>Now there’s a dedicated benchmark: MCP‑Universe (Salesforce AI Research). It tests models against real MCP servers across 6 domains - Location navigation, Repository management, Financial analysis, 3D design, Browser automation, Web searching - using execution‑based checks on 231 tasks.</p> <p>A detail I like: tasks are multi‑step. Runs typically take ~6-8 tool calls, which puts pressure on long‑context handling and planning. In early results, GPT‑5 tops the overall leaderboard and leads in most domains (with Grok‑4 slightly ahead in browser automation).</p> <p>Bottom line: MCP is maturing fast — and now it’s measurable. What gets measured gets improved, so expect rapid progress in tool use, planning, and context management next.</p> <p>Link: https://lnkd.in/g4KcpJFW To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>            Babysitting AI agents
        Claude Code is a general purpose agent disguised as a coding agent.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It searches the web. It integrates with tools through MCP. It executes multi-step workflows. All the basics you’d expect.</p> <p>But it’s not just a general-purpose agent. It’s a code-first agent, not just an agent that helps you code, but one that codes to expand what it can do.</p> <p>Having bash access, Claude Code controls your operating system directly. It can install packages, script CLI tools together, and automate anything you can do in a terminal. Combined with file system access, it can search, read, and modify files across your computer. Your entire system becomes its workspace, if you allow it.</p> <p>More importantly, it writes code. When other agents hit a wall because no tool exists for a task, Claude Code can build one. It can write parsers for unusual file formats. It can reverse-engineer undocumented APIs and build clients. It can create data processing pipelines, automation scripts, whatever the task demands. The tool doesn’t exist until it needs to exist.</p> <p>It’s also composable, a capability unique to CLI-based agents. Claude Code can spawn specialized versions of itself as subagents, each with full tool access. Give it web search and file creation, and it can replicate features like “Deep Research”. What others hard-code, it builds from primitives.</p> <p>Code-first agents don’t just use tools. They script them together, build new ones, and orchestrate multiple instances of themselves to create capabilities that didn’t exist before. Other agents work within their constraints. Claude Code can read its own source code, analyze how it works, and modify its configuration files to change its behavior.</p> <p>#anthropic #agent #claudecode #llm #ai To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>            3 followers

        Validation rules. Are they widely used? I got to know them only when I reached the API flow. However, they may be more commonly used without a package, such as Filament? Don't know. I got to know it only because of AI Tools and API scope, but not on the frontend.

        i’ve wired up a bunch of MCP servers but not for semantic code search.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>i decided to try out the new Claude Context MCP plugin by Zilliz using Claude Code and I found it quite interesting and I think you will as well.</p> <p>so what is it? it’s a powerful semantic code search tool that gives your AI coding assistants deep understanding of your entire codebase. Instead of grep or basic keyword search, you can ask natural language questions about your codebase and get actual relevant code back.</p> <p>the setup is interesting (mermaid diagram in comments), it takes your code: • parses it through AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)[1] (chunk by structure) • chunks it intelligently • embeds the code using openai/voyage/ollama/gemini  • stores everything in Milvus, created by Zilliz vector db which is well known for being a beast in handling large-scale vector search across billions of embeddings</p> <p>to top it all off, it uses one of my favorite data structures, Merkle Trees.

RAG הוא שם כולל לכל הטכניקות לבניית מערכות שבהן מחברים מודלי שפה לידע חיצוני לצורך שיפור התוצאות.מערכת RAG כוללת מאגר ידע כגון בסיס נתונים, אוסף של מסמכים ואפילו כלי חיפוש בגוגל. כשאנחנו מזינים בקשה למערכת, היא מאתרת פיסות מידע רלוונטיות בתוך מאגרי הידע. אלה עוברים יחד עם הבקשה המקורית אל מודל השפה, והוא עונה על הבקשה – בתקווה שהתשובה תהיה מלאה, מדויקת ורלוונטית, בזכות המידע שהמודל קיבל. אחזור מידע (retrieval) רלוונטי והעברתו למודל השפה משפרים באופן מוכח ומשמעותי את הביצועים של מודלי שפה במגוון משימות המצריכות ידע – כולל מענה על שאלות (Q&amp;A), מיון (Classification), סיכום ועוד.למערכות RAG ישנם שימושים שונים, והיתרון המובהק שלהן הוא היכולת לרתום מאגרי ידע במטרה להשלים את המשימה. מאגרים אלה הם הדרך העיקרית להוסיף ידע חדש ולעדכן ידע קיים במודלי השפה, ולכן הם מוצלחים כל כך. בנוסף, בחירה דינמית של מאגרי הידע פותחת את הדלת למודלי שפה מותאמים אישית.קחו לדוגמה עוזר אישי (digital assistant). במקרה הזה מערכת ה-RAG מחוברת למאגרי ידע מקצועיים. בזכות היכולות של מודל השפה, המערכת יכולה לשוחח בשפה טבעית על מגוון נושאים טכניים, לייעץ ולענות על שאלות. בנוסף, המערכת יכולה להפנות את המשתמש למקורות הידע עצמם (באמצעות ציטוט, citation), כמעין עוזר מחקר.דוגמה נוספת היא שימוש בידע של המשתמש עצמו, כלומר – מאגר הידע מבוסס על הדאטה של המשתמש, וכך מערכת ה-RAG מתאימה לו את תשובותיה. המשתמש יכול להעלות אוסף קבצים אישיים למערכת ולבקש ממנה לסכם נושאים המופיעים במסמכים, לשאול היכן נמצא דיון בנושא כזה או אחר, לבקש שתרכיב מצגת סיכום מהמסמכים וכן הלאה.כאשר ניגשים לבנות מערכת RAG צריך לקבל החלטות רבות. בשלב הראשון עלינו לבחור מודל שפה – פתוח או סגור. מודל סגור הוא מודל מסחרי איתו עובדים בעזרת ממשק API, ואין לנו גישה לאופן פעולת המודל או המשקולות שלו. לעומתו, במודל פתוח גם הקוד וגם המשקולות נגישים לבחינה, אימון והגשה (inference). את המודל הפתוח ניתן להתאים לעולם התוכן שלנו בעזרת אימון fine tuning. בחלק מהמקרים הגשה עצמית של מודלים פתוחים עשויה להיות עדיפה על פני מודלים סגורים, אך היא מצריכה מיומנות.החלק השני בבניית מערכת RAG הוא חיבור למאגרי ידע. לחיבור הזה ישנם היבטים רבים, הכוללים את אופן אינדוקס הידע, עיבוד מקדים של הטקסט והתמונות, חלוקה לפסקאות או משפטים, ניקוי, עיבוד של דאטה טבלאי, המרת הדאטה לייצוג וקטורי (vector embedding) שיכול לשפר את איכות החיפוש, חיפוש מבוסס מילים, חיפוש סמנטי או שילוב שלהם, מספר הדוגמאות לאחזור, מיון רלוונטיות, סינון, שיכתוב הדוגמאות, סיכום ועוד. זה ממש על קצה המזלג, ורק על השלב הזה יכולתי לכתוב מאמר שלם. החלק הזה קריטי, כי כמו שאומרים – garbage in, garbage out: אם אחזור הידע יהיה לא מדויק ולא רלוונטי מספיק, איכות התשובות של מודל השפה תפגענה מיד, והסיכוי להזיות יגדל.לאחר מכן ניתן להוסיף מרכיבים למערכת: מודלי שפה נוספים שנבחרים בצורה דינמית על פי אופי המשימה; שימוש בכמה מאגרי ידע במקביל; שימוש בכלים המודדים את איכות המסמכים שנמצאו, כך שניתן יהיה ללקט את קטעי המידע הרלוונטיים ביותר מתוך המסמכים שחזרו; מודלי שפה שיודעים לבקש ביצוע אחזור נוסף אם הם לא מצאו עדיין את התשובה שחיפשו; והרשימה ממשיכה, כיאה לתחום מחקר פעיל ביותר.האתגר העיקרי בבניית מערכת RAG הוא להגיע לרמת איכות ודיוק מקסימליים. כל חלקי המערכת משפיעים על התשובות הסופיות, ולכן מוכרחים לתכנן אותה בקפדנות. כחלק מההכנה, כדאי לבחון ולהשוות מודלי שפה על מנת להגיע לשילוב ראוי של עלות מול דיוק. בחירת מאגרי הידע, אופי האחסון, אחזור והצגת הידע למודל הם קריטיים בייצור תשובות נכונות ורלוונטיות בזמן ריצה סביר. כדי לבחון את טיב המערכת שבניתם, ניתן להשתמש בדוגמאות מתויגות (דוגמאות המכילות תשובות ידועות מראש) ולבצע בחינה ידנית או אוטומטית של התוצאות.המורכבות הגדולה נובעת בעיקר מההתנהגות הלא צפויה לעתים של LLMs. לדוגמה, בחלק קטן מהמקרים מודל השפה ישגה, אפילו שהידע שקיבל מכיל את התשובה הנכונה. הסיבות לא ברורות נובעות מסתירה בין הידע הפנימי של המודל לידע המוצג בפניו. הצוות שלנו חוקר דרכים בהן ניתן לשלוט בהתנהגות המודלים במקרים כאלה, בעזרת הוראות מותאמות ואימון נוסף.יחד עם זאת, ניתן לשפר את איכות המערכת כולה באמצעות התאמת המודל לביצוע משימות RAG. לצורך כך, הצוות שלנו פיתח כלי קוד פתוח שמאפשר לאמן ולשפר את יכולות ה-RAG של מודלי שפה.כדי לבנות מערכת RAG איכותית ומדויקת, נדרשת הבנה עמוקה של ההיבטים השונים שלה. כמובן שאי אפשר לוותר על תהליך ניסוי וטעיה, שעוזר לשפוך אור על הפשרות השונות הכרוכות בעיצוב המערכת. רק כך נוכל לבנות את המערכת האידיאלית לבעיה שאותה אנחנו מנסים לפתור.מערכות RAG מייצגות ארכיטקטורה חדשה המשלבת מודלי שפה עם מאגרי נתונים. בזכות השילוב הזה יש להם פוטנציאל לבצע משימות עתירות ידע, כגון עוזרים דיגיטליים מותאמים אישית, צ’אטבוט בשירות לקוחות ומערכות ידע ארגוניות. ואם לשפוט לפי המחקר הפעיל בתחום, זוהי רק ההתחלה.הכותב הוא חוקר במעבדת ה־NLP בארגון Intel Labs. במעבדה נחקרות סוגיות הקשורות למודלי שפה כגון RAG ,Efficient Inference, עבודה עם קונטקסטים ארוכים, שימוש בסוכנים ועוד.אינטל ממשיכה להוביל את תחום הבינה המלאכותית עם הפתרונות המתקדמים ביותר לתעשייה. מעבדי Xeon מהדור השישי והמאיצים הייעודיים Gaudi 3 מאפשרים לארגונים להאיץ את פיתוח והטמעת יישומי AI בקנה מידה גדול, תוך שמירה על יעילות גבוהה ותמורה כלכלית יוצאת דופן. אינטל מציעה גישה פתוחה וגמישה המאפשרת שילוב חלק של חומרה ותוכנה ממגוון ספקים, ובכך נותנת לארגונים את הכלים הדרושים להם להאצת השימוש ב- GenAI ובמודלים גדולים, כמו גם להקטנת התלות במערכות קנייניות של יצרנים אחרים. מרכזי הפיתוח של אינטל בישראל, שממוקמים בחיפה, פתח תקווה, ירושלים וקריית גת, משחקים תפקיד מפתח בעיצוב הדור הבא של טכנולוגיות עיבוד ו-AI , וממשיכים להניע את החדשנות הגלובלית של החברה באמצעות שילוב של ביצועים, גמישות וחדשנות מתמדת.כאן אפשר לבחור תחומי עניין, ואנחנו נתאים לך כתבות באופן אישי. הכתבות יופיעו כאן וברחבי האתר, והסימון שלנו יהיה הנה הכתבות שהתאמנו לך אישית. רוצה לרענן העדפות? בבקשה, אנחנו לא שופטים זה המקום להכיר את החברות, המשרדים וכל מי שעושה את ההייטק בישראל (ויש גם מלא משרות פתוחות!) #תוכן מקודםהניוזלטר שלנו עושה את האקסטרה מייל עם העדכונים והחדשות של השבוע© כל הזכויות שמורות לגיקטייםפיתוח אתריםdesigned by designed by  | פיתוח אתריםבגלל זה אנחנו מקפידים שהן לא יציקו, אבל הן מאפשרות לנו לתת לכם תוכן בחינם.</p> <p>פרסומות עוזרות לנו להתקיים ולהתמקד במה שחשוב: ליצור עבורך תוכן מקצועי ומעניין. כדי להמשיך ליהנות מגיקטיים, כדאי להסיר את החסימה מהאתר שלנו. אנחנו מבטיחים לא להציף.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[מערכות RAG יכולות לפתור את תופעת ההזיות של LLMs, אבל כדי לבנות אחת טובה תצטרכו לקבל הרבה החלטות קריטיות (ולקוות שתגיעו הכי קרוב למושלם)]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intel Labs Introduces RAG-FiT Open-Source Framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation in LLMs - Intel Community</title><link href="https://danielfleischer.github.io/blog/2024/intel-labs-introduces-rag-fit-open-source-framework-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-in-llms-intel-community/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intel Labs Introduces RAG-FiT Open-Source Framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation in LLMs - Intel Community"/><published>2024-10-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://danielfleischer.github.io/blog/2024/intel-labs-introduces-rag-fit-open-source-framework-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-in-llms---intel-community</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielfleischer.github.io/blog/2024/intel-labs-introduces-rag-fit-open-source-framework-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-in-llms-intel-community/"><![CDATA[<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>                        Success!

                Scott Bair is a key voice at Intel Labs, sharing insights into innovative research for inventing tomorrow’s technology. Intel Labs researchers Daniel Fleischer, Moshe Berchansky, and Moshe Wasserblat collaborated on RAG-FiT.HighlightsIntel Labs introduces RAG-FiT, an open-source framework for augmenting large language models (LLMs) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) use cases. Available under an Apache 2.0 license, RAG-FiT integrates data creation, training, inference, and evaluation into a single workflow, assisting in the creation of data-augmented datasets for training and evaluating LLMs in RAG settings. This integration enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques, allowing users to easily generate datasets and train RAG models using internal or specialized knowledge sources.The library assists in creating data to train models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which allows users to finetune a subset of parameters in a model. The Python-based framework is designed to serve as an end-to-end experimentation environment, enabling users to quickly prototype and experiment with different RAG techniques, including data selection, aggregation and filtering, retrieval, text processing, document ranking, few-shot generation, prompt design using templates, fine-tuning, inference, and evaluation.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the RAG-FiT framework (formerly known as RAG Foundry), Intel Labs researchers augmented and fine-tuned Llama 3.0 and Phi-3 models with diverse RAG configurations, showcasing consistent improvements across three knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks.Using RAG Systems to Address LLM LimitationsDespite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have inherent limitations. These models can produce plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, struggle with factual accuracy, lack access to up-to-date information after their training cutoff, and struggle in attending to relevant information in large contexts.RAG enhances LLMs performance by integrating external information using retrieval mechanisms. Retrieving specific data from knowledge bases outside the model can effectively address knowledge limitations, which in turn can reduce hallucinations, improve the relevance of generated content, provide interpretability and could be vastly more cost efficient. Furthermore, recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs for RAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing that of larger proprietary models.How RAG-FiT WorksAs an experimentation environment for researchers, the backbone of the RAG-FiT library consists of four distinct modules: data creation, training, inference, and evaluation. Each module is encapsulated and controlled by a configuration file, ensuring compatibility between the output of one module and the input of the next file. This modular approach allows isolation and independent experimentation on each step, enabling the production of multiple outputs and the concurrent execution of numerous experiments. Evaluation can be conducted on the generated outputs as well as on any feature within the data, including retrieval, ranking, and reasoning.Figure 1. In the RAG-FiT framework, the data augmentation module saves RAG interactions into a dedicated dataset, which is then used for training, inference, and evaluation.Dataset creation: The processing module facilitates the creation of context-enhanced datasets by persisting RAG interactions, which are essential for RAG-oriented training and inference. These interactions encompass dataset loading, column normalization, data aggregation, information retrieval, template-based prompt creation, and various other forms of pre-processing. The processed data can be saved in a consistent, model-independent format, along with all associated metadata, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility across different models and experiments.The processing module supports the handling of multiple datasets at once through global dataset sharing. This feature allows each step of the pipeline to access any of the loaded datasets, enhancing flexibility and allowing for complex processing procedures. Furthermore, the module includes step caching, which caches each pipeline step locally. This improves compute efficiency, and facilitates easy reproduction of results.Training: Users can train any model on the augmented datasets. A training module is used to fine-tune models from the datasets created by the previous processing module. The training module relies on the well-established training framework, TRL, for transformer reinforcement learning. The module also supports advanced efficient training techniques, such as PEFT and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to customize the LLM for specific use cases without retraining the entire model.Inference: The inference module can generate predictions using the augmented datasets with trained or untrained LLMs. Inference is conceptually separated from the evaluation step, since it is more computationally demanding than evaluation. Additionally, users can run multiple evaluations on a single prepared inference results file.Evaluation: Custom metrics can be easily implemented or users can run current metrics, including Exact Match (EM), F1 Score, ROUGE, BERTScore, DeepEval, Ragas, Hugging Face Evaluate, and classification. Users can run metrics locally on each example, or globally on the entire dataset, such as recall for classification-based metrics. In addition to input and output texts, metrics can utilize any feature in the dataset, such as retrieval results, reasoning, citations, and attributions. In addition, the evaluation module uses a processing step called an Answer Processor, which can implement custom logic and perform many tasks, including cleaning and aligning outputs.Performance of RAG-FiT Augmentation TechniquesTo illustrate the utility of the framework, Intel Labs researchers conducted experiments involving retrieval, fine-tuning, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and a negative distractor documents technique. The team compared Llama 3.0 and Phi-3, two widely accepted baseline models, using enhancement methods across TriviaQA, PubMedQA, and ASQA, three knowledge-intensive question-answering datasets. The TriviaQA and PubMedQA datasets contain relevant context, while for the ASQA dataset, retrieval was done over a Wikipedia corpus using a dense retriever.The team measured and reported EM for TriviaQA, STR-EM for ASQA, and accuracy and F1 Score for PubMedQA. In addition, researchers evaluated two Ragas metrics: faithfulness (the relation between the generated text and the context) and relevancy (the generated text and the query). Overall, the two models showed consistent improvements across the three knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks.Figure 2. Evaluation results of baseline and different RAG settings for the three datasets and two models tested. In bold are the best configurations per dataset, based on the main metrics.For TriviaQA, retrieved context improved the results, fine-tuning the RAG setting boosted the results, but fine-tuning on CoT reasoning (which includes training on a combination of gold passages and distractor passages) decreased performance. For this dataset, the best method is model dependent. For ASQA, every method improved upon the baseline, CoT reasoning produced consistent improvement in both models, as well as fine-tuning of the CoT configuration, which performed best. Finally, for PubMedQA, almost all methods improved upon the baseline (with one exception), CoT reasoning improved on the untrained RAG setting, but for fine-tuning, the RAG method performed best in both models.Finally, the faithfulness and relevancy scores often did not correlate with the main metrics, or with each other, possibly indicating they capture different aspects of the retrieval and generated results, and represent a trade-off in performance.The results demonstrate the usefulness of RAG techniques for improving performance, as well as the need to carefully evaluate different aspects of a RAG system on a diverse set of datasets.

It aims to generate more informative and contextually appropriate responses to user queries by leveraging the retrieval of relevant passages or documents. This technique has significant potential in various applications, among them is Open Domain Question Answering; it is a field of research that focuses on developing systems capable of comprehending and answering a wide range of questions posed by users. It involves extracting relevant information from vast amounts of unstructured data using information retrieval techniques.Information retrieval used to rely on sparse techniques based on word statistics. In the traditional approach, documents were represented by a bag-of-words model, where the presence or absence of specific words determined the relevance of a document to a query. Score functions, like BM25 and TF-IDF, use word frequencies to score documents, balancing how frequently a keyword appears in a document versus how prevalent the word is in general. One popular DB is the Elasticsearch DB which uses the Lucene text search engine; it is based on word statistics and edit distance (a syntax method).With advancements in natural language processing and machine learning, information retrieval has shifted towards denser representations using embeddings. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of words and phrases, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the content; this enables more accurate matching of queries with relevant documents, as embeddings can capture subtle semantic similarities that traditional word statistics fail to capture. The shift from sparse to dense representations has significantly improved the performance and precision of retrieval systems. For an introduction to neural IR, see (Mitra and Craswell 2018); for a review of IR for Q&amp;A, see (Abbasiantaeb and Momtazi 2021).This blog serves as an introduction to dense retrieval and we focus on two dense document retrieval models: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR, Karpukhin et al. 2020) and Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT (ColBERT, Khattab and Zaharia 2020). Both models use Semantic Search to find the relevant documents. Semantic search means we use a text’s dense representation to measure similarity between a given query and the potential relevant documents. The two models use different methods of storing the documents’ vectors and measuring similarity between queries and documents. We will compare the models by measuring accuracy and latency on a known benchmark, called Natural Questions (NQ, Kwiatkowski et al. 2019), a collection of user submitted questions where answers can be found in Wikipedia articles.We would like to introduce fastRAG, a framework developed at Intel Labs and released as an open-source software recently. The goal of the framework is to enable rapid research and development of retrieval-augmented generative AI applications. These can be used for generative tasks such as question answering, summarization, dialogue systems, and content creation, while utilizing information-retrieval components to anchor LLM output using external knowledge.An application is represented by a pipeline, typically comprised of a knowledge-base (KB), retriever, ranker and a reader, typically an LLM, which “reads” the query and retrieved documents, and generates an output. One can experiment with different architectures, models, benchmarking the results for performance and latency. Several of the models we offer are better suited for Intel hardware, achieving lower latency with comparable accuracy; on that in the next blog post.In the field of information retrieval, relatively recent updates promote the use of transformer encoder models as retrievals: documents in the knowledge-base are encoded as vectors and stored in an index. At runtime, the query is encoded as a vector and vector similarity search is used to find the most relevant documents. Similar process is used in re-ranking retrieved documents, where the encoding is done on-the-fly, specifically for the retrieved documents.Among the dense retrievals there are several approaches. One approach is to use a single token’s embeddings as a representative of the entire document. DPR (Karpukhin et al. 2020) is an example of that approach, where the encoders are trained to “summarize” the entire document in the first token’s embeddings. The method is a form of a bi-encoder, since it uses two encoders, one for the query and another for the documents; see illustration.Another approach is called Late Interaction, as defined first in ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia 2020). The idea is to save (and index) the encoded vectors for all the words in the documents. At run-time the query vectors are compared with all the documents words’ vectors (hence the “late” in late interaction) thus retrieving more relevant documents than DPR. Notice that indexing every token, instead of just the first token for each document, can increase the index size.Later refinements to this work, namely ColBERT v2 and PLAID (Santhanam, Khattab, Saad-Falcon, et al. 2022; Santhanam, Khattab, Potts, et al. 2022) helped reduce the index size and latency time thanks to two main improvements: first is quantization and compression of the vectors in the index. Secondly is a set of heuristics that cluster the vectors using the K-means algorithm, hierarchically choose the relevant documents’ tokens for the query tokens based on the clusters’ centroids. ColBERT v2 with PLAID index achieves state of the art retrieval performance with a low latency, close to the order of sparse retrieval (BM25, Lucene, Elasticsearch, etc.) but with much higher accuracy.The first step is creating a documents store of the type PLAIDDocumentStore. The store requires three paths: checkpoint, collection and an index.A ColBERT checkpoint is an encoder model, fine tuned for the task of retrieving. It’s based on a BERT architecture. One can download a trained checkpoint, for example here, trained by the paper authors. Encoders can be fine-tuned using these instructions: training. Next is the collection of documents which comprise the corpus. The collection should be a signle tsv file with columns: id, text, title (optional). Finally, the index is the vectors index created using the same checkpoint, encoding all tokens in the corpus, compressing and saving the result.We provide a script to create a PLAID vector index using a ColBERT encoder and a documents collection in here.Once we have all the ingredients, we initialize the document store:Next we define a retriever using the document store we just define:We define a pipeline; it has the following form:We can use the Haystack pipeline API to connect with external components. In this example the pipeline contains just the retriever:Running the queries through the pipeline is very easy:The results is a hash map with documents key containing a list of results: documents with relevancy scores.To test ColBERT, we will use the Natural Questions benchmark (Kwiatkowski et al. 2019). The external knowledge is a collection of Wikipedia passages.As a baseline, we’ll use the original implementation of DPR, together with a checkpoint that was fine-tuned on Natural Questions, see download instructions. DPR model is released under the CC-BY-NC 4.0 license.DPR uses the Faiss vector search library (Johnson, Douze, and Jégou 2019). We test two configurations for storing the vectors: flat and HNSW. Flat is slow but accurate, since an exhaustive similarity search is done. HNSW (Malkov and Yashunin 2018) is an approximate vector search method; the vectors are organized into a graph to enable faster than linear search. Building an optimal HNSW graph requires some parameter tuning; these control the trade-off between speed, accuracy and index size.For ColBERT, we use the ColBERTv2 checkpoint from here, which was fine-tuned on the MS MARCO (Bajaj et al. 2018) dataset, which comprised of Bing questions and answers based on web search results.We report recall and MRR values for k values of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. We also measure latency (at k=100) (ms/query), and report the vector index size in GBs, as there is a trade-off between performance and accuracy.Measurements done on an Intel AWS instance, with a Xeon processor. AWS instance type is r6i.16xlarge; 32 cores, 512GB RAM, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8375C CPU @ 2.90GHz. Conda 23.1.0, python 3.9.16, AMI image ami-0f1a5f5ada0e7da53, Amazon Linux 2, version 5.10.177-158.645.amzn2.x86_64. The Wikipedia text collection size is 13GB.First, we note there is a difference in accuracy between the ColBERT model and DPR. The quality of the embeddings generated from a trained encoder is crucial for high quality retrieval. As the DPR encoders were fine-tuned on the Natural Questions dataset, this is probably one of the reasons explaining the difference.Next, we compare the two indexing methods for DPR: flat and HNSW. Flat index query takes 35x longer than HNSW, at almost 1.5 seconds per query. HNSW is faster, with only a small accuracy penalty; however, index size is bigger, at ~2.3x the size of the flat index.It is notable that although ColBERT encodes and stores all the documents tokens, thanks to its optimizations, the index size is comparable to a flat Faiss index, storing only the first token’s embedding for each document.One of the goals was to present the clear trade off between accuracy and performance, more specifically, between recall, latency and memory usage (the index size, as these are stored in-memory). To summarize, we introduced two dense retrieval algorithms, ColBERT with a PLAID index and DPR. We tested these on the open-domain Q&amp;A dataset Natural Questions, measuring accuracy and latency.Experience the capabilities of ColBERT in fastRAG through the following Notebook example.
