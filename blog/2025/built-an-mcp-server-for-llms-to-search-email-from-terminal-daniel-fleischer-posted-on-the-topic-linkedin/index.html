        📬 I built an MCP server that lets LLMs search my email from the terminal
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The server connects Claude to email search via the mu CLI tool. Now I just ask it things like: “Find emails with PDF attachments from last April” ⚡</p> <p>🛠 No custom frontend. No heavy framework. Just a CLI tool made smarter.</p> <p>💡 I learned that MCP servers are basically API translators — they take complex developer SDKs and flatten them into simple function calls that LLMs can actually use.</p> <p>🎯 The bigger picture: This pattern can breathe new life into existing CLI tools and services. Complex APIs → Simple, declarative functions → Natural language queries.</p> <p>This isn’t a product — just an experiment in stitching new capabilities into existing workflows.
